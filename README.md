# basic-snack-game
This mini project is a basic version of the classic snack game in CLI    built in C




For moving the snack we use the keys:  w,s,a,d
To force a stop, just press space key



Obs:
* The render is not auto update at time, you will have to press the dirrection each single time to make it move, improvement are on the way.
* This version work well only in windows right now

I would like to invite you to upgrade this version for the communite
